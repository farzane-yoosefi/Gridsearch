# Gridsearch
>> These notes serve to demonstrate my machine learning knowledge to potential employers while also helping beginners learn complex concepts in simple terms.

## What Is Gridsearch?
### Before learning gridsearch we have to know parameters and hyperparameters 
**Parameter** : Parameters are adjusted during training, it means you don't adjust them .

Here is how parameters are adjusted :
1. **See the data** : Model sees the data
2. **Makes Guess** : It uses its current patrameters to make a guess.
3. **Check the error** : It measures how wrong the guess was
4. **Adjust parameters** : It tweaks the parameters to less be wrong next time.
By repeating this process billions of times , the parameters are slowly adjusted untill the best patterns for an accurate prediction are learned .

**hyperparameter** :
Basically Hyperparameters are settings you choose before training that controls how the model learns.

Here is an overview of how hyperparameters are adjusted : 
1. You **Choose** the hyperparameter values.
2. Training begins using these fixed settings.
3. The model learns its ***parameters* based on data, guided by hyperparameters.
4. You evaluate model performance.
5. You often tune hyperparameters to find the best learning strategy





























Gridsearch in a machine learnig tool which applies computations to find the best hyperparameters and tune the model in best possible way.
